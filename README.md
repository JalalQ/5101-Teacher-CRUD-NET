# Introduction

This project is an extension of my previous project, [Teacher Read Functionality](https://github.com/JalalQ/SchoolWebProject_A3). In this project I add-up the 
'add' and 'delete' functionalities.

A full description of the scope of the assignment is given in the attached file, **5101_A4_F2020.pdf**:
* [x] Use AJAX to add/ update teacher.
* [x] Updated the CSS file so to improve the appearance of the site.
* [x] Add/ Delete functionalities have been added.
